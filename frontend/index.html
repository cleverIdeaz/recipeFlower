great job!  worked for the recipe view and the share links wwork!   only thing is that categories and sub categories can always just be in a single div in a scrollable list. dont need more than one box for those.

also for the H1 and H2 or category and subcategory. when the screen resizes really small the text stays really big and i think it should scale down with the size of the box. We dont ever want the H1 and H2 to take up more than maybe 1/5th of the top portion of the card.  in this same veign lets move the back arrow and share button outside of the index card rounded corner box and place them above the box. in the top center lets also put a search bar that will allow you to search for recipes w/ a clear button to clear your search. when you search it will take you to a special view with all recipe names returned in a single list with the category and subcategory annotated in parentheses ( cat |subcat)

also we still have some text that needs to change to white when in dark mode ( share button, back arrow, and category selection / sub category selection lists)
